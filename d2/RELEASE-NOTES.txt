Special notes for this release
------------------------------
* AddOns now use filename extension ".dxa". Your old AddOns will not work anymore. You can either re-download them or simply rename them from *.zip to *.dxa.


Known issues
------------
* On Windows the mouse is not correctly released if using ALT+TAB to minimize the game. This is not a bug in the program but rather the SDL library. It can be worked around by pausing the game and using ALT+ENTER to get the game to windowed mode. The mosue should not be stuck then anymore.
