.B mvlcreate
is an utility to create MVL files, like that found in the DESCENT II
videogame and played by the D2X package. MVL archives are files with a .mvl
extension which contains one or more MVE (movie) files.

You'll find some MVL/MVE files as part of the Descent II Registered datafiles.

The command was first created by Josh Cogliati in 1999, then modified by

This manual page was written by Paolo Ulivi <pulivi@libero.it>,
for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
