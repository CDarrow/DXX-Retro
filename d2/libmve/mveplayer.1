.SH NAME
mveplayer \- Standalone MVE movie player.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mveplayer
.RI [ options ]

.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B mveplayer
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.B mveplayer
is a standalone player for MVE movie files, like that found in the
DESCENT II videogame and played by the D2X package. It supports all MVE
files around, so if you find one that doesn't work, please report this as
a bug. Note that the MVE files found in the Macintosh version of Descent II
are not really MVE files, they appear to be some sort of quicktime-related
format.

If you give to
.B mveplayer
the name of an MVL file, i.e. an archive containing one ore more MVE files,
it will print the full contents of the archive to stdout.

You'll find some MVE files as part of the Descent II Registered datafiles.
