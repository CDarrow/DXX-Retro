New Features
  - Host Game Options / Advanced

    - Extra Primaries [Requested by: Many Pilots]
        Can duplicate all primaries in a level (x2, x3, or x4).  Intended
        to balance older levels built for Kali's fastjoin.


    - Extra Secondaries [Requested by: Lotharbot]
        Can duplicate all primaries in a level (x2, x3, or x4).  Intended
        to balance older levels built for Kali's fastjoin.

    - Cap Secondaries [Requested by: Kiln]
        Can restrict homers and smarts to a max of 6 or 2 (each).  Intended
        for use in place of a standalone LH version. 

    - Short Spawn Invuln [Requested by: Drakona]
        If spawn invulns are on, they are 500 ms in duration instead of
        2000.

    - Respawn Concussions [Requested by: Kiln]
        Concussions picked up from the level are respawned when fired.
        Concussions you spawn with don't respawn or drop when you die.

    - Retro Protocol [Requested by: many pilots, mainly Spud & Scoundrl]
        Enables a number of netcode changes -- biggest is P2P.  Smaller 
        ones: two way loss monitoring, higher fidelity position packets,
        removed more short packets, drop out of order position packets,
        door opening and item pickup packets sent differently. 

    - Allow Colored Dynamic Lighting [Requested by: Jediluke]
        If unchecked, colored dynamic lighting is disabled (regardless of
        player's personal setting). 

    - All Ships Blue [Requested by: Jediluke]
        What it says on the tin. ;)

    - Alternate Colors For Ships 6 & 7 [Requested by: DJCJR]
        Instead of light orange and light green, ships 6 and 7 are dark
        purple and white, so they don't get confused with others. 

    - Items Allowed: Vulcan Ammo added [Requested by: Sirius]
        Can now ban vulcan ammo.

  - Autoselect order: Added Quad Lasers [Requested by: Naphtha]
        Can now put quad lasers and regular lasers in different spots in 
        autoselect order. 
        QUIRK: Quad Lasers start out below your autoselect line.
        You will probably want to move them. 

  - Energy, Vulcan Ammo, and Low Shield Warnings  [Requested by: Jediluke]
      Audio and text warnings for low vulcan ammo, energy, and 
      shields. (Miscellaneous Settings)

  - Network Status Monitor [Requested by: Many Pilots]
       Lag, Upstream Loss, Downstream Loss, Proxy/Direct shown by player score.  
       Can turn off with F6. 

  - Pause screen improvements [Requested by: Drakona]
        Shows game flags, ping to player not server.

  - Framerate is now an in-game option [Requested by: Behemoth]

    - Plasma is slightly quieter [Requested by: Clone7]

    - Reactor shots are slightly quieter [Requested by: Clone7]

    - "Hog File Wrong Size" error message downgraded from error box to log entry
        [Requested by: Lotharbot, Descentile]

    - "You Failed Sending Important Packets" timeout takes 15 seconds instead of 5
        [Requested by: Drakona]

    - HUD view that shows all weapons also shows vulcan ammo
        [Requested by: Lotharbot]

        the powerup.  [Experimental]


Bug Fixes
    - Team Reactor Bug [Requested by: Jediluke]
        Reactor kills now reduce team score.

    - Ships no longer vibrate in place in a netgame [Requested by: Drakona]

    - Autoselect / Vulcan Ammo [Requested by: Drakona]
       - Autoselect interacted strangely with picking up vulcan ammo when vulcan 
         was empty; now behaves as if you just picked up the cannon. 

    - Joystick inputs did not reset on respawn [Requested by: Scoundrl]

    - Reticle drawn strangely at certain screen resolutions [Requested by: Jediluke]

    - Missiles Conserved [Requested by: Gwar, Jediluke]

        extras elsewhere in the level.
