<h3>1.4X6 - 1/16/2018</h3>

This experimental release is for D1X-Retro only.

* Coop
* * Don't respawn robots in coop.
* Demos
* * Fix rewind bug where rewinding through a frame with multiple damage sources would show damage and energy incorrectly.
* Mac
* * Switch from XCode to scons for building.  Note: message box tech is disabled for now, crashes will only display to the terminal or the log.  To see them, run Descent from Terminal using the command `./d1x-retro-1.4.X6.app/Contents/MacOS/d1x-rebirth`
* Observer
* * Don't lock to player 1's view while observing in coop.
* * Observers no longer disconnected when other observers connect or disconnect.
* * Observers no longer see themselves connect as an unpatched client when someone else connects to the game.
* * Observers will now be properly told that they can't observe a game that hasn't yet started.
* * You can now observe players directly in first and third person view.  Use Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+8 to observe players 1 through 8.  Use Ctrl+9 and Ctrol+0 to cycle back and forth through the connected players and free observing.  Use Ctrl+- for first person view and Ctrl+= for third person view.
* * Added the above options to the multiplayer F1 help menu, and streamlined the menu to only display relevent commands.
* * Documented the /noobs command (kick all observers) in the F1 help menu.
* * Shields and shield changes are now visible to observers.
